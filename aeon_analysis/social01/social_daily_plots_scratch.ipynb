    "- Block Page\n",
    "  - Header: \"Arena: block_start_time - start_end_time\"\n",
    "  - Plot 1: Patch stats: Patch rate for each patch as a bar, sampled patch threshold values as overlaid scatter\n",
    "  - Plot 2: Weight: Weight over time\n",
    "  - Plot 3: Position: X-Y line position over time with running cumulative total distance traveled\n",
    "    - Option 1: 3d plot with time in z-axis, cumulative distance in colorbar\n",
    "    - Option 2: 2d plot with time / cumulative distance in colorbar / linewidth\n",
    "  - Plot 4: Ethogram: Contiguous blocks of time spent in given regions. Downsampled to 1s windows?\n",
    "    - One row for each: nest, corridor, field, patch1, patch2, patch3; text overlay of total distance traveled within each continguous block?\n",

    "    - All subject plots: 6::\n",
    "    - For each patch plot, info should include patch number and patch rate\n",
    "    - Each in the set of (each subject, each patch rate, each patch number) should have its own unique color\n",
