# Things to do

- remove "Ignore" Sessions based on google docs spreadsheet
- look at "pelletTrigger" - "pelletDeliver" times to see when there are issues with fed (e.g. possibly multiple pellets getting delievered, or jam issues)
    - get video frames from when times are too long
- find sessions where mice are uninterested: too few rewards / long times between rewards
- find cooperative strategies in social sessions: when mice alternate pellet rewards
    - for each pellet reward, associate it with mouse
    - need multianimal tracking, find frame of each pellet reward, find mouse closest to pellet

# Misc

- Commit 1b53c11 in 'aeon_mecha' is last commit on main for exp01 data
- Once the python aeon env is setup, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/blob/reorg/docs/using_datajoint_via_jupyterhub.md) to use jupyterhub on the hpc.

# Notes on Psychometric analysis:

- Data isn't normalized by starting weight % (did they discriminate better when they had lower weights?)
- Are social and individual sessions randomized or not? (did they perform better on social because they had already been trained on individual)
- Sessions weren't randomized by thresholds: (all 1500 sessions came first, so for the harder thresholds they had already learned the task)

- data for feb 15,16,17 is not in: /nfs/winstor/delab/data/arena0.1/socialexperiment0
- how do you ungroup current groups in spreadsheet??
